							<p id="p75" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>A father comes in, from the right. He settles comfortably at the head of the table, unfolds his newspaper importantly.</i>)</p>
							<p id="p81" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Calling to kitchen.</i>) Good morning, Annie.</p>
							<p id="p93" class=“M1 FATHER”>Good morning, Annie.</p>
							<p id="p98" class=“M1 FATHER”>Annie…</p>
							<p id="p100" class=“M1 FATHER”>Did I find a seed in my orange juice yesterday morning?</p>
							<p id="p102" class=“M1 FATHER”>I’m sure you did, Annie. Nonetheless I think I may have detected a small seed.</p>
							<p id="p104" class=“M1 FATHER”>Seeds can wreak havoc with the digestion, Annie.</p>
							<p id="p106" class=“M1 FATHER”>They can take root. And grow.</p>
							<p id="p108" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Father drinks his orange juice carefully and reads his newspaper.</i>)</p>
							<p id="p110" class=“M1 FATHER”>Yes, good morning, Lizzie Boo.</p>
							<p id="p112" class=“M1 FATHER”>Charlie and I…</p>
							<p id="p114" class=“M1 FATHER”>You certainly may, Lizzikins. I’d be delighted to have the pleasure of your company, provided-</p>
							<p id="p116" class=“M1 FATHER”>I said PROVIDED you sit quietly, without leaning back in your chairs, and don’t fight or argue.</p>
							<p id="p118" class=“M1 FATHER”>I said you <i>may</i> sweetheart. </p>
							<p id="p122" class=“M1 FATHER”>Thank you Annie.</p>
							<p id="p126" class=“M1 FATHER”>Hmmm?</p>
							<p id="p129" class=“M1 FATHER”>I’ll tell you one thing. If there’s a war, no one gets cream. If there’s a war, we’ll all have to settle for top of the bottle.</p>
							<p id="p131" class=“M1 FATHER”>Yes. Your mother and I are both thinking about that. And we’re both looking forward to it. As soon as you children learn to sit up straight…</p>
							<p id="p133" class=“M1 FATHER”>then I see no reason why we shouldn’t all have a pleasant meal together every evening.</p>
							<p id="p135" class=“M1 FATHER”>No, Charlie. Not tonight. Because tonight we’re giving a small dinner party. But I hope very much you and Liz will come downstairs and shake hands.</p>
							<p id="p137" class=“M1 FATHER”>Well you’ll just have to learn, sweetie pie. Half of life is learning to meet people.</p>
							<p id="p138" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Pause. The Father fixes him with a steely gaze.</i>) Was that a crack?</p>
							<p id="p141" class=“M1 FATHER”>That was a crack, wasn’t it?</p>
							<p id="p143" class=“M1 FATHER”>That sounded very much like a smart-guy wisecrack to me. And people who make cracks like that don’t normally eat in dining rooms.</p>
							<p id="p145" class=“M1 FATHER”>Then we’ll ignore it. We’ll go on with our breakfast.</p>
							<p id="p148" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>To Girl.</i>) Thank you, Annie.</p>
							<p id="p150" class=“M1 FATHER”>Goodbye, darling. Don’t be late. Say good morning to the driver. Sit quietly in the car. Work hard. Run. Run. Goodbye. (<i>Girl goes off.</i>)</p>
							<p id="p151" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Father returns to his paper. Pause</i>)</p>
							<p id="p153" class=“M1 FATHER”>Certainly. Certainly you may. (<i>He carefully extracts the second section and hands it to his son.</i>)</p>
							<p id="p155" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Finally:</i>) This won’t mean much to you, but the government is systematically ruining this country.</p>
							<p id="p157" class=“M1 FATHER”>Oh really. And who is Miss Kelly, pray tell?</p>
							<p id="p159" class=“M1 FATHER”>I don’t remember any Miss Kelly.</p>
							<p id="p161" class=“M1 FATHER”>I see. And what has she been telling you?</p>
							<p id="p163" class=“M1 FATHER”>I see.</p>
							<p id="p165" class=“M1 FATHER”>I see.</p>
							<p id="p167" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Long pause. Then:</i>) Annie!</p>
							<p id="p169" class=“M1 FATHER”>I’d very much like some more coffee, please.</p>
							<p id="p171" class=“M1 FATHER”>You tell Miss Kelly she’s wrong.</p>
							<p id="p173" class=“M1 FATHER”>I’ll tell you exactly why: if the government keeps on handing out money no one will want to work. And if no one wants to work, there won’t be anyone around to support such things as private schools. And if no one is supporting private schools, then Miss Kelley will be standing on the bread lines along with everyone else. You tell Miss Kelly that, if you please. Thank you, Annie. </p>
							<p id="p175" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Father returns to his paper.</i>)</p>
							<p id="p178" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Reading</i>) Hmmm?</p>
							<p id="p180" class=“M1 FATHER”>We’ll leave when we always leave.</p>
							<p id="p182" class=“M1 FATHER”>Nonsense.</p>
							<p id="p184" class=“M1 FATHER”>A minute or two late…</p>
							<p id="p186" class=“M1 FATHER”>You tell everyone to concentrate on that hymn.</p>
							<p id="p188" class=“M1 FATHER”>It’s that new stoplight on Richmond Avenue. It affects our timing.</p>
							<p id="p190" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Putting down the paper.</i>) Miss Kelly again, eh?</p>
							<p id="p192" class=“M1 FATHER”>Now you listen to me, Charlie. Miss Kelly may be an excellent teacher. Her factoring may be flawless, her geography beyond question. But Miss Kelly does not teach us politics. Nor does she teach us how to run our lives. She is not going to tell you, or me, to leave in the middle of a pleasant breakfast, and get caught in the bulk of the morning traffic, just so that you can arrive in time for a silly hymn. 
							Long after you’ve forgotten that hymn, long after you’ve forgotten how to factor, long after you’ve forgotten Miss Kelly, you will remember these pleasant breakfasts around this dining room table.</p>
							<p id="p194" class=“M1 FATHER”>And here is your mother to prove it.</p>
							<p id="p196" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Remaining seated.</i>) I know people who leap to their feet when a beautiful woman enters the room.</p>
							<p id="p199" class=“M1 FATHER”>I also know people who rush to push in their mother’s chair.</p>
							<p id="p202" class=“M1 FATHER”>And finally, I know people who are quick to give their mother the second section of the morning paper.</p>
							<p id="p205" class=“M1 FATHER”>Now Charlie: take a moment, if you would, just to look at your lovely mother, bathed in the morning sunlight, and reflected in the dining room table.</p>
							<p id="p208" class=“M1 FATHER”>Look at her, Charlie, and then ask yourself carefully: Which is worth our ultimate attention? Your Mother? Or Miss Kelly?</p>
							<p id="p210" class=“M1 FATHER”>Never mind, dear. Which, Charlie?</p>
							<p id="p212" class=“M1 FATHER”>Good, Charlie. Fine. (<i>He gets up, taking his section of the paper.</i>) And now, I think you and I should make a trip upstairs before we say goodbye, and are on our way.</p>
							<p id="p215" class=“M1 FATHER”>(<i>Father and Son leave the room.</i>)</p>

							<p id="p10" class=“M2 CLIENT”>(<i>Pause.</i>) What are they asking again?</p>

							<p id="p40" class=“M3 ARTHUR”>(<i>He shifts it from hand to hand behind his back, then holds out two fists.</i>)</p>

							<p id="p61" class=“M3 ARTHUR”>You don’t want it.</p>
							<p id="p63" class=“M3 ARTHUR”>I mean you already have a perfectly good dining room.</p>

							<p id="p88" class=“M3 ARTHUR”>I am absolutely amazed you’d say that.</p>
							<p id="p90" class=“M3 ARTHUR”>Neither do I. Maybe we should defer the dining room. (<i>He starts for door, right.</i>)</p>
							<p id="p94" class=“M3 ARTHUR”>Selling the dining room? Is that what you told Mother I’d do?</p>
							<p id="p96" class=“M3 ARTHUR”>I’ll be lucky if I keep this spoon.</p>

							<p id="p183" class=“M3 BOY”>I am, Dad. Yesterday I had to walk into assembly while they were still singing the hymn.</p>
							<p id="p185" class=“M3 BOY”>Everyone looked at me, Dad.</p>
							<p id="p187" class=“M3 BOY”>I can’t, Dad…</p>
							<p id="p189" class=“M3 BOY”>It’s not just the new stop light, Dad. Sometimes I come in when they’re already doing arithmetic. Miss Kelly says I should learn to be punctual.</p>
							<p id="p191" class=“M3 BOY”>She said if everyone is late, no one would learn any mathematics.</p>
